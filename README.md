# BMMOntology
Repository for the Business Motivation Model (BMM) Ontology

The Business Motivation Model (BMM)[1], proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG), provides a scheme or structure for developing, communicating, and managing business plans in an organized manner. BMM defines all the elements or concepts involved in a business plan, including mission, vision, strategy, tactic, goal, objective, business policy and business rule. 

We have designed an OWL ontology for describing business plans based on BMM (bmm.owl). Our ontology includes the core concepts and constraints defined in the BMM specification. Additionally, we have included an example of document (utal.rdf) containing the description of a business plan, following the BMM OWL ontology.

The BMM OWL ontology has been developed by: Claudio Mu√±oz (Universidad del Bio Bio, Chile), Renzo Angles (Universidad de Talca, Chile), Angelica Caro (Universidad del Bio Bio, Chile), Gilberto Gutierrez (Universidad del Bio Bio, Chile).
